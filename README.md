# Facial Keypoint Detection

<img src="keypts.png">

This project is about defining and training a convolutional neural network to perform facial keypoint detection, and using computer vision techniques to transform images of faces.

This project is directly inspired by the @Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree and has been modified in my way in <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">Pytorch</a>.

## File Description
- custom_dataset.py: Create the dataset using the Dataset class from Pytorch
- inference.ipynb: Notebook for inference
- network.py: Create the architecture of the CNN according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00977.pdf">this paper</a>
- training.ipynb: Notebook using Google Colab GPU to train the CNN
- transformation.py: Python file that contains all classes to transform the data (images and keypoints)

## Pipeline

### Customized Dataset
```
class FacialKeypointsDataset(Dataset):
    """Face Landmarks dataset."""

    def __init__(self, csv_file, root_dir, transform=None):
        pass

    def __len__(self):
        pass

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        pass
```
